📌 Project Overview:
- Sponzaar is an AI-assisted sponsor CRM and outreach tool.
- It's built for student organizers, event managers, and hackathon teams.
- The goal is to simplify sponsor discovery, tracking, communication, and deliverables for any kind of event (e.g., college fests, hackathons, workshops).
- The app includes sponsor management, tier tracking, email automation, deliverable tracking, and a sponsor marketplace.
