You are upgrading the existing Automations page in the Sponzaar app.

The goal is to streamline sponsor outreach using saved templates, pitch deck links, smart filters, and bulk sending logic — all without a backend.

Update the existing UI and logic with the following improvements:

---

🔁 1. Upgrade Email Templates with Variable Support & Preview
- Modify the email body textarea to support variables like:
  - {{sponsorName}}, {{eventName}}, {{tier}}, {{yourName}}
- Below the template form, add a preview card:
  - Render the filled version using a mock sponsor object:
    ```js
    {
      sponsorName: "TechForge",
      eventName: "Maximally Startup Makeathon",
      tier: "Gold",
      yourName: "Rishul"
    }
    ```
- Add note near textarea: “Supports variables like {{sponsorName}}”
- Store templates in local state, with options to edit/delete inline

---

📎 2. Add Pitch Deck Library Section
- Create a section to save + display pitch deck links
- Each entry has:
  - Deck Name
  - URL
- Store in a local array (deckLibrary)
- Allow adding/editing/removing deck links
- In Outreach panel, allow selecting 1 pitch deck link to send

---

🎁 3. Add “Outreach Pack” Feature (Template + Deck + CTA)
- New section: Create an Outreach Pack
- Fields:
  - Outreach Pack Name
  - Email Template (dropdown)
  - Pitch Deck (dropdown)
  - CTA Label (e.g. “Schedule Call” or “View Brochure”)
- On save, store in outreachPacks array
- Display packs as cards with:
  - Pack Name
  - Preview Button
  - Use This Pack button
  - Delete Pack

---

📬 4. Improve Bulk Send Controls
- Let user select sponsors from table who are not contacted
- Add dropdowns to:
  - Choose an Outreach Pack
  - Display how many sponsors selected
  - Button: “Send Outreach Email”
- On send:
  - Use console.log for each sponsor:
    `Email sent to {{sponsorEmail}} using {{packName}}`
  - Change status of each to Contacted = true
  - Add toast: “Emails sent to 5 sponsors using Hackathon Pack”

---

📓 5. Add Activity Log (Bottom of Page)
- After sending emails, log results in scrollable div:
  - Example:
    - ✅ Sent to techforge@gmail.com using “Hackathon Pack”
    - ⚠️ Skipped startuphub@gmail.com (already contacted)
- Logs should be stored in session state or a useRef array
- Use `text-sm text-gray-400` inside `bg-zinc-900 p-2 rounded`

💡 Design Instructions
- Keep theme minimal black + white (Tailwind)
- Use ghost buttons, pill tags, clean white-on-black structure
- Avoid animations, focus on fast rendering + clean UX

All data should be stored in local React state only. No backend, database, or email sending is needed in this version.
